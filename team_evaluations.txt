4003-243 OOP: Project 02 Team Evaluation

For each team member, including yourself, evaluate him or her based
on the following items.  Check one box for each question.  Be honest

to help determine the individual grade for each person.
The freeform comments evaluating yourself and your teammate are most important.

Enjoyed working with Mike. It was a good experience to work with a team

other programmers work and adapt from them.
