It was a lot fun working in a team to do the project. We both put in a
large amount of effort into this project. We spent many hours in the
SSE team rooms on a few weekends and met in the dorms to work on the
project.

Enjoyed working with Mike. It was a good experience to work with a team
on a programming project. It was also a great opprotunity to see how
other programmers work and adapt from them.
