What did you learn by doing this assignment?

	By doing this assignment, we learned a lot more about
	Java GUIs as well as working in a team on a software project.


What was easy about this assignment?

	Creating the account classes and having previous experience with GUIs.


What was harder than you originally thought?

	Organization and structure of the program were two elements harder
	than we originally anticipated. We eventually used a "state machine" pattern for the ATM GUI, but we should
	have incorporated object-oriented design into the pattern.


What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?

	Go over GUIs more and go more in depth than what we did.


What would you have liked to do in this assignment?

	Add keyboard shortcuts and make the buttons beep like a real ATM.


What other issues would you like to discuss?

	None at this time.
